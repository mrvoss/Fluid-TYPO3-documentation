4.1.3 Differences from standard Controllers
===========================================

![FluidTYPO3 File contexts, Controllers](../Images/FileContext/Controllers.svgz)

There is not much difference between a standard Extbase plugin "Action Controller" and a Flux-enabled controller. The hint lies in
the name "-enabled" which means a _Flux-enabled controller is simply an extended controller with a few added behaviors_:

* A [Provider](../4.2.CustomFluxProviders/4.2.1.UseCasesProviders.md) is resolved by Flux and made available in the controller.
* The View class is different; allowing (ViewHelperVariableContainer-)variables to be read from specific sections.
* Several initialisation methods have been added, allowing for example common template variables to be added.
* Delegation to other controller classes is possible.
* It is not needed to define a plugin which is allowed to execute each controller action - all `*****Action` methods can be called.

Other than these additions this type of controller class is a standard controller: it supports arguments, property mapping,
validation, errorAction, redirection etc. just like all other controller types.
